// Simple C++ program to display "Hello World" 

// Header file for input output functions 
/*#include are directives for the preprocessor when using c++*/
#include<stdio.h>

// main function - 
// where the execution of program begins 
int main(void) 
{ 
	// prints hello world.  printf stands for "print formatted"

} 

// a compiler is what translates the C, java or python and converts it to binary for reading by the computer

// compiled file a.out (a is short for assembly.output) is the binary output for delivery to the computer.  

// compiled C code, a.out OR helloworld can be called by entering "./a.out" OR "./helloworld"

// when compiling you can use "clang -o miscfilename hello.c" to generate a specific file name output

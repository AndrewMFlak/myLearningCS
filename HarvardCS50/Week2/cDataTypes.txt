Data Types available for use in C
List:

- true or false

char (1 byte)
- a single character like 'y' or 'n'

double (8 byte)
- a longer version of a float similar to int/long relationship

float (4 byte)
- a real number which can contain decimals

int (4 byte)
- integer a whole number which can count up to about 4 billion

long (8 byte)
- long is the data type to use when a variable is going to possibly go over 4 billion

string (? byte)
- one or more characters inside of double quotes.  a string is essentially just an array of characters.  To optimize memory usage of string a \0 is required after letters/characters to denote the end of string.  The \0 takes up 1 byte of ram.



1 Byte = 8 Bits;
1 Gigabyte of RAM (random access memory) = 1 Billion Bytes (1,000,000,000.00)
